**Quality Assurance - Test Automation Assessment - English**


**Objective**

The objective of this assessment is to validate your test automation abilities using Selenium, your knowledge on programming and best practices for automation. We expect to see a full project alongside with the instructions on how to run the tests – all committed in a code repository like GitHub, Bitbucket or Gitlab.

This project should be a showcase of your test automation knowledge – having the test cases automated and working (passing or failing according to the expected result) is crucial, but other aspects are going to be considered as well: how the project is organized, quality of selectors, usage of test automation design patterns and quality of the code are some of the aspects we will evaluate. The overall quality of your project is going to tell us what is your expertise level and if you fit in the position we have interviewed you for (or may interview you in the future).

Some tips:
- Follow best practices. The entire solution can be coded without the usage of any automation anti-pattern.
- Be mindful of your time, make sure that what you deliver is complete and functional.
- Remember to have all your tests working properly. This is the most important aspect of the assessment.

**Development**

- The test cases should be automated using:
- - Selenium Webdriver, Google Chrome.
- - You can use any programming language but we prefer one that is officially supported by Selenium (C#, Java, Python, Ruby, JS).
- - Feel free to use any other libraries to help with the development.
- Every test case has a Data Table:
- - For tests with more than one data entry, the test should be executed once for each entry.
- Important: Not all test cases listed should pass. What really matters is that they pass or fail according to the manual test case.

**Evaluation**

The code will be evaluated using the following criteria:
- The automated test cases results should match what the manual test case execution results would be.
- Code quality – proper indentation, comments where needed, no duplication, etc.
- Good programming and test automation best practices.
- Project structure.

**Delivery**
- Commit the code into GitHub, Gitlab or any other public source code repository:
- - It can be in your personal account or a new account
- - Remember to exclude from the commits the project files of your IDE
- Send an email to the HR person that you are in contact with. Make sure to include the following items in the message:
- - Full name
- - Link for the project
- - Any other additional information that you deem necessary
- Deadline: 5 days.

**Important!**

In case the website to be automated goes down, please send an email to danilo.guimaraes@e-core.com and the HR person that contacted you telling what happened. We will investigate and return to you ASAP.
